A white tiger at the Madrid Zoo
White tigers have been recorded in India since 16th century CE. The first white tiger was captured in 1915.
 A white tiger named Mohan was captured by the king of Rewa, Martand Singh, in 1951 from the forest of Sidhi district, which is now part of the Sanjay Dubri Tiger Reserve. White tigers found in zoos around the world are the offspring of Mohan.[1][2][3][4] White Bengal tigers are distinctive due to the color of their fur. The white fur is caused by a lack of the pigment pheomelanin, which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to orange Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and become heavier than the orange Bengal tiger.[citation needed] They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults.[citation needed] White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2â€“3 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of 200 to 230 kilograms (440 to 510 lb) and can grow up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger's stripes are like fingerprints, with no two tigers having the same pattern. The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin; if an individual were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible.</p></b>
